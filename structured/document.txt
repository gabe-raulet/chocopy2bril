1. The top level

    The top level of our language consists of global variable definitions, function definitions,
    and top-level statements. The corresponding Bril program will have a main function that
    corresponds to this top level. This means that the main function will define the variables
    that occur at the top level, and will contain instructions that correspond to the top-level
    statements. These instructions may include call expressions that reference functions defined
    at the top-level, and may reference global variables as well. The top-level is represented
    in our language grammar by:

        (*) program ::= {var_def | func_def}* stmt*

    where var_def and func_def are the productions corresponding to global variable definitions
    and function definitions respectively, and stmt is the production corresponding to a valid
    language statement.

1.1. Global variable definitions

    All variable definitions, including global definitions, follow the following grammar:

        (*) var_def ::= typed_var = literal NEWLINE

    where

        (*) typed_var ::= ID : type
        (*) type ::= "int" | "bool"
        (*) literal ::= "None" | "True" | "False" | NUM (.)

    In order to easily access the type and initialized literal value of variables, we create use
    two separate dictionaries to store this information. We create a dictionary named "types" that
    maps each variable name to its defined type and a dictionary named "inits" that maps each
    variable name to its defined literal. Suppose we parse the following line at the top level:

        (*) {id} : {type} = {literal} NEWLINE (.)

    Then the the "types" and "inits" dictionaries associated with the top-level must have

        (*) types[id] == type
        (*) inits[id] == literal

    For example, given the following program:

    """
    var1: int = 15
    var2: int = 345
    var3: int = None

    var4: bool = True
    var5: bool = False
    var6: bool = None
    """"

    The parser function get_decls() will return the following dictionary:

    {"inits": {"var1": 15,
               "var2": 345,
               "var3": null,
               "var4": true,
               "var5": false,
               "var6": null},
     "types": {"var1": "int",
               "var2": "int",
               "var3": "int",
               "var4": "bool",
               "var5": "bool",
               "var6": "bool"}}
